// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which an analysis is done to determine the business rules and data models needed for the software."
const design = "This is the third step,in which the software is design of the software is determinded."
const Implementation = "This is the fourth step, in which the software is programmed/coded."
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, in which the software is tested for quality and bugs."
const maintain = "This is the last step, in which maintenance, support, and installation is figured out."
